# Tetris
My remake of the game "Tetris"

In directory "TetrisBuilds", the builds for Mac and Windows can be found. 
For Mac, open directory "TetrisMAC" and find the executable file, open it in terminal and play.
For Windows, open directory "TetrisWin" and find the exe file, open it in cmd and play.

If you want, you can open the project via whichever C# IDE you prefer.

CONTROLLS:
-> W - rotate current piece
-> A - move current piece left
-> D - move current piece right
-> S - make current piece fall faster
